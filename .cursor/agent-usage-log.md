## How to update

When you use an agent or subagent:

1. **Append a log entry** at the end of the **Log** section (above this "How to update" block):
   - Format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | agent-name | optional context`
   - Example: `2025-01-26 15:30 | plan-critic | User asked to review The-plan`

2. **Update the Tally** at the top:
   - If the agent is new: add a row with count `1`.
   - If the agent exists: add `1` to its count.
   - Re-sort the table **most used → least used** (descending by Count).
   - Remove the *none yet* row once there is at least one agent.

3. Keep **How to update** at the very bottom; don’t append log entries below it.
